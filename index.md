# Joseph Willem Ricci

A personal website and blog I plan on building

Learning computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, online, from Copenhagen, Denmark.

Topics I plan on blogging about:
- The intersection of brain-computer interface and blockchain is provenance and monetization of ideas and knowledge
- A principle for community growth: value for all, at every timescale and at every stage of growth
- Peak community: the vulnerability/trust feedback loop and psuedonymity as a tool for establishing critical trust
- Two models of maximising consent: negative feedback, governance and competition
- Quantified self and self-report: a virtuous cycle of physical and mental health
- How "creator coins" can enable better apprenticeship and mentorship education models 


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Joseph-Willem-Ricci/Joseph-Willem-Ricci.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Joseph-Willem-Ricci/Joseph-Willem-Ricci.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
